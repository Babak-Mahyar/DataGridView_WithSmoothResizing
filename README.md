A question was raised by a member of the Stackoverflow site as follows:

When resizing columns/rows, the dgv doesn't visually update until you finish. It also doesn't show the regular "resizing bar" across the cells to show where it will end up.
Is there a way to make the row/column update live with moving the mouse instead of just when its finished?

This code was written by me in response to the above question.
Of course, it may have problems and bugs. Not fully tested, but in the initial test, it almost covered the topic.

This code was developed in Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 4.6.2 on Windows 11.
